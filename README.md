## Dotfiles

A place to store my configs I have painstakingly built up over the years.

Some of these files contain sensitive data. Therefore I have encrypted these files with [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt).

Some of the shell init files are forked from Peter Ward's [Shell Startup](https://bitbucket.org/flowblok/shell-startup). Read more about it [here](http://blog.flowblok.id.au/2013-02/shell-startup-scripts.html)
